What it is
    This is our first collaborative front-end project which utilizes our knowledge gained thus far.  We desired
    an environment where the user could expand their TALKIN' SKILLZ WIF WORDS in a responsive environment. The app
    provides some information to begin however it is designed to provide a repository for unfamiliar terms, ensuring
    you never need to look up a word more than once.

What we Used
    React and React-Router
    Javascript ES-6
    HTML
    CSS
    Bootstrap 
    Jquery
