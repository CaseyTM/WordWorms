What it is
	This is our first collaborative front-end project which utilizes our knowledge gained thus far.  We desired 
	an environment where the user could expand their TALKIN' SKILLZ WIF WORDS in a responsive environment. The app 
	provides some information to begin however it is designed to provide a repository for unfamiliar terms, ensuring
	you never need to look up a word more than once.

What we Used
	React and React-Router
	Javascript ES-6
	HTML
	CSS
	Jquery
	The worst APIs in the world

Challenges and Solutions
	Our only regret is that we had but one Rishi!
