What it is
	This is our first collaborative front-end project which utilizes our knowledge gained thus far.  We desired 
	an environment where the user could expand their TALKIN' SKILLZ WIF WORDS in a responsive environment. The app 
	provides some information to begin however it is designed to provide a repository for unfamiliar terms, ensuring
	you never need to look up a word more than once.

What we Used
	Bootstrap
	React and React-Router
	Javascript ES-6
	HTML
	CSS
	Jquery
	The worst APIs in the world

Challenges and Solutions
	Our only regret is that we had but one Rishi!

MVP
	Give the user the ability to create and view custom generated lists of words.
	Generate a random quiz from the User's data.
	Routing for each section.

Our Stretch Goals 
	Give the user the ability to Build their own quiz structure.
	Implement Redux
